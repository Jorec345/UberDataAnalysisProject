# UberProject
Analyzed employee uber usage data. The data had usage by departments and by user code e.g working late etc. The analysis gave insights on which departments use uber oftenly and for what reasons. 
The analysis also gave insights into the possible frustrations faced by the employees while ordering uber especially where there was an order and cancelation.
